# TS Result
A simple package for handling error state in your applications.

I have written this package for myself as I often end up creating something similar to this, however, you are more than welcome to use it at your own discretion

```bash
npm install @doro-hd/ts_result
```

```bash
yarn install @doro-hd/ts_result
```

```bash
pnpm install @doro-hd/ts_result
```
